## Business Impact Assessment

### Customer Experience Impact - HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem:** Users experiencing significant delays and frustration

**Evidence from System Analysis:**
- **User Behavior Pattern:** 426 duplicate APP.ReqGetAllTxn requests (transaction history calls) indicate users repeatedly clicking during 3.2s average response times
- **Performance Data:** rtsp_q2-2025-08-07-150005.log through rtsp_q2-2025-08-09-150117.log show consistent 3.2s average delays
- **Peak Impact Documentation:** Transaction processing times exceeding 15 seconds during high-load periods (rtsp_q2-2025-08-09-150117.log:179 shows peak queue depth of 343)

**Business Risk:**
- Customer satisfaction degradation due to perceived system unresponsiveness
- Potential revenue loss from abandoned transactions during slow periods
- Increased customer service costs from performance-related complaints

### Operational Efficiency Impact - HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem:** System resources being wasted on preventable duplicate processing

**Evidence from Transaction Analysis:**
- **Duplicate Request Measurement:** 426 APP.ReqGetAllTxn calls Ã— 3.2s average = 1,363 seconds of redundant processing capacity
- **Payment Processing Load:** 538 PSO.RespPay.PAY transactions Ã— 3.2s = 1,721 seconds total processing time for revenue-critical operations
- **Capacity Documentation:** Log entries showing active-sessions=2500/2500 (100% thread pool utilization) across multiple time periods
- **Queue Analysis:** 6,989 in-transit measurements reveal 90th percentile at 286 transactions, indicating frequent high-load conditions

**Business Impact:**
- Infrastructure overcapacity requirements due to inefficient resource utilization patterns
- Reduced system throughput for revenue-generating payment transactions during peak periods
- Operational overhead from managing performance bottlenecks and capacity planning

### Revenue Protection Impact - CRITICAL PRIORITY

**Problem:** Payment processing bottlenecks directly threaten revenue

**Evidence from Payment Transaction Analysis:**
- **Payment Volume Analysis:** 538 PSO.RespPay.PAY transactions represent core revenue-generating operations across analyzed time period
- **Payment Performance Documentation:** Average 3.2s response times with maximum delays >15s recorded in rtsp_q2-2025-08-09-150117.log
- **System Failure Analysis:** 148 total failures out of 15,077 transactions (0.98% failure rate) includes payment-critical operations
- **Peak Load Impact:** Payment transactions occurring during queue depth spikes (343 peak vs 130 median) experience additional delays

**Business Risk:**
- Direct revenue impact from failed payment transactions and user abandonment during slow periods
- Competitive disadvantage compared to faster digital payment alternatives
- Regulatory compliance risk for CBDC performance standards and public trust requirements
